1. There is a number of two digits the sum of whose digits is 5 , and if 10 times the digit in the place of tens be added to 4 times the digit in the place of units, the number will be inverted. Then the number is:

**Step 1:** "There is a two-digit number" →

- Let the **digit in the tens place = x**,
- Let the **digit in the units place = y**,
- So the number can be written as “the digit in tens place followed by the digit in units place.”

---

**Step 2:** "The sum of its digits is 5" →

- x + y = 5 ✅

---

**Step 3:** "If 10 times the digit in the place of tens plus 4 times the digit in the place of units" →

- That is: 10 × (digit in tens place) + 4 × (digit in units place) = 10x + 4y

---

**Step 4:** "is equal to the inverted number" →

- When we invert, the units digit moves to the tens place,
so we must also multiply it by 10 to show it’s now in the tens place.
- Inverted number = digit in units place followed by digit in tens place → 10 × (digit in units place) + (digit in tens place) = 10y + x

---

**Step 5:** Make the equation

- 10 × (digit in tens place) + 4 × (digit in units place) = 10 × (digit in units place) + (digit in tens place)
- Substitute x and y: 10x + 4y = 10y + x

1. A number when divided by 221, leaves a remainder 30. If the same number is divided by 13, the remainder will be:

### Question says:

> A number when divided by 221 leaves remainder 30.
> 
> 
> That means:
> 
> **Number = (221 × some number) + 30**
> 

Let’s call that “some number” = k

So, **Number = 221k + 30**

---

### Now we divide that same number by 13.

So we divide:

**(221k + 30) ÷ 13**

---

### Step 1: Split into two parts

We can split it like:

- (221k ÷ 13)
- (30 ÷ 13)

Because division distributes like that for remainders.

---

### Step 2: See if 221 is divisible by 13

13 × 17 = 221

→ So **221** divides perfectly by **13** (no remainder).

That means **(221k ÷ 13)** gives **0 remainder** always.

---

### Step 3: Only 30 part matters now

Since the 221k part gives remainder 0,

we just need the remainder when **30 ÷ 13**.

---

### Step 4: Divide 30 by 13 normally

13 × 2 = 26

Subtract: 30 - 26 = 4

So remainder = 4

---

✅ **Final Answer: 4**

1. 7 is added to a certain number and the sum is multiplied by 5 . The product is then divided by 3 and 4 is subtracted from the quotient . If the result comes to 16, then what is the original number?

**Step 1:** “7 is added to a certain number” →

Let the number = x

So, after adding 7 → x + 7

---

**Step 2:** “The sum is multiplied by 5” →

(x + 7) × 5 = 5(x + 7)

---

**Step 3:** “The product is then divided by 3” →

[5(x + 7)] ÷ 3 = (5(x + 7))/3

---

**Step 4:** “4 is subtracted from the quotient” →

(5(x + 7))/3 − 4

---

**Step 5:** “If the result comes to 16” →

(5(x + 7))/3 − 4 = 16

---

**Step 6:** Solve for x

(5(x + 7))/3 = 16 + 4

(5(x + 7))/3 = 20

Multiply both sides by 3 → 5(x + 7) = 60

Divide by 5 → x + 7 = 12

x = 12 − 7 = 5

---

✅ **Answer:** Original number = 5
